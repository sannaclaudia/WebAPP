Layout in order configuration:
 the entire ingredient list with the same information as the freely accessible page with the list of ingredients
 (in the left part) and the current configuration, i.e, the base dish, size and the selected ingredients 
 (in the right part). The total price (sum of cost of base dish and ingredients) must be shown in the top right 
 part, and it must be updated dynamically while the user interacts with the web application.

Order submission:
 When the user submits the order to the restaurant, the restaurant checks that the order satisfies all the 
 requirements in this text. If not, a suitable message is shown (e.g., “not enough tuna”), and the user is sent 
 back to the configurator to fix their order, starting from the situation as left before submission. Note that 
 the availability of ingredients must be updated by the restaurant only upon order confirmation.

Cancellation of an order:
 Users can, in addition to the previous operations, also cancel an order already confirmed by the restaurant.
 Note that if ingredients with limited availability have been used in the order, the portions become available 
 again. To be able to cancel an order, at authentication time the user must have used the 2FA procedure with a TOTP.
 Note that users can also choose to authenticate without using the 2FA procedure: in this case they can perform all 
 operations except cancellation.
